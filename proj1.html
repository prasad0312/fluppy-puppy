                        various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.
                        It was originally bred as a herding dog,
                        for herding sheep. It has since been used in many
                        other types of work, including disability assistance,
                        search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare.
                        It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according
                        to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale
                        had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.

                    Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones
